Greetings! 🌍 I'm Boyu Fan, a junior at UC Berkeley double majoring in Economics and Data Science. My academic journey is marked by a deep engagement in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Haas School of Business. Here, I'm exploring the complexities of LSTM and RNN within TensorFlow, and innovating on the future work of Human-AI interfaces("Can ML offer simple tips to help humans?").



## 🌱 Conservationist 
In the heart of Kenya, I found my calling as a conservationist with the Lion Light project, a initiative blending technology and environmental stewardship.

As the Chief Advocate, I've been instrumental in installing innovative lion lights, which uses blinking light patterns to ward off lions from the villager’s livestock. My role extends beyond just installation; it involves research, community engagement, and raising awareness. By raising $7000, we've expanded the project, installing 800 additional lights and earning heartfelt thanks from the local Kenyan community. 

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://boyufan1.github.io/borisfan.github.io/portfolio/) for more information.



## 🍎 Teaching 
As a torchbearer in the realm of teaching, I engage with students as a tutor and undergraduate instructor in Linear Algebra and Principle in Data Science. My approach to teaching is anchored in the philosophy of active and engaged learning. I believe in creating a dynamic learning environment where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their learning journey. 🌱📘
